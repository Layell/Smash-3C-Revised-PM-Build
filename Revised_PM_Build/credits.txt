Welcome

Smash 3C Revised Pack is a Project M build that focuses primarily on bringing a Tournament edition (TE) build with the newest Smash 3C content. For good measure, we updated a number of stages, and adjusted the music too in order to match the colorful Smash 3 style.

This pack uses tournament safe costumes and has no gameplay changes from Project M. Changes to the models do exist and are minimal and for cosmetic purposes only.

This pack will be updated as necessary with new costumes or bug fixes.

To see individual credits for costumes please see our Smash 3C website here: https://smash3cproject.wixsite.com/smash3c

At the bottom of this I will include the full Legacy TE credits for prosperity.

Notes on file size

To keep this pack under 2 gigs, you will notice some optimizations for music tracks, where music PM replaced has been restored and the PM tracks moved to secondary slots.

This pack uses ColorSmash to reduce file size for CSPs. To learn how to update with this tool see this thread: https://smashboards.com/threads/shared-csp-data-near-ci8-quality-sub-cmpr-size.434310/

Setup
########################################

Instructions (hackless):

Materials needed:
2GB non-SDHC SD card
Nintendo Wii (or Wii U) and one Wii Remote
A copy of Super Smash Bros. Brawl

Run Brawl and be sure that you have deleted all custom stages.
Format your SD card and be sure it's formatted to FAT32.
Simply extract the folders from the zip file provided in the download, and place them in the root of your SD card (in other words copy and paste the files from your PC to the card). 
After inserting your SD card into your Wii, launch Brawl, and go to Stage Builder. If done correctly, the screen should freak out for a second, and then you should get to a screen that looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/DxcvUZk.png

From here select play, wait for a bit, and Legacy TE should launch from there.

Legacy TE Special Thanks (from davidvkimball)
########################################

Atlas, lostmyhead, and Elliot Gindi for all the vital conversations early on and helping bring the TE vision to life early on in its concepting stage. 

Ca$ino Wolf for consistently playtesting TE and providing feedback from the perspective of a top competitive player.

Yohan1044 for his unparalleled meticulousness in everything he does. Absolutely essential for this build as a leader and a modder. 

WorseDoughnut for being an amicable fellow project lead and a great friend. 

Moe (Mac Cornick) for lovingly creating stock icons based on the current TE poses and renders for 1.1. 

Fracture for working wonders with his replay code, CSS controls code, and the incredible feat that's the TE code menu. 

DukeItOut for expanding what's possible with stage sound and graphics effects and the Alternate Stage Loader. 

tryptech, MetalLegacy, Layell, EggTimer, and Xenthos from the Cosmetic Standardization Project Backroom for helping make fabulous character cosmetics and making them work for TE 2.0. This was no small feat! 

########################################
Testing + Feedback
########################################

Huge thanks goes to ZaTaisho and Drazerg for the detailed playtesting they have done for 1.0. Each came back with lists, images, and specific steps to fix any oddities or bugs they may have found. Thanks to ZaTaisho and codes for bringing early builds to local tournaments and collecting feedback from peers. Thank you to both FroDu and Ca$ino Wolf for the hours of testing as well as both of them for saving matches for the TE Trailer. 

Thanks to ZugZug for being TE 1.0's blind playtester and jumping right in. 

Thanks to mawwwk for being an outstanding playtester and providing incredible feedback so that stages in TE 2.0 are lagless, truly 1:1, and optimized for tournament play. He was engaged and involved every step of the way, and is responsible for a lot of the match clips in the TE 2.0 trailers. TE 2.0 would not have the polish it has without him.

Thanks to our blind playtesters since TE 2.0: Ash_Marks, Kirbeast, PoptheKirby, KimballDonald, waffeln, and Eon for stepping up and providing feedback during the final stretch.
